# Discord Bot Starter TS

This is a TypeScript template for creating Discord bots using the [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) library. It provides a basic structure and some useful features to help you get started quickly and easily.

## How to use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install the required packages
3. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and fill out everything
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the bot in development mode
5. Write your bot logic in the `src` folder

## Scripts

### Development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Starts the bot using `ts-node-dev`, which auto-restarts on code changes.

### Production mode

```bash
npm start
```

Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript and starts the bot using `ts-node`.

## Features

### Command handler

A flexible and modular way to create and manage commands for your bot. You can add new commands by creating a file in the `src/commands` folder that follows this structure:

```typescript
export default class extends Command {
  public constructor(client: CustomClient) {
    super(client, {
      // The name of the command
      name: CommandName.Example,
      // A brief description of what the command does
      description: "This is an example description.",
      // The category of the command
      category: CommandCategory.General,
    });
  }

  public async execute(
    interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction
  ): Promise<void> {
    // Command logic goes here
    await interaction.reply({
      content: `This is an example answer.`,
    });
  }
}
```

You can also organize your commands into subfolders based on their categories. For example, you can create a file in `src/commands/moderation/ban.ts` for a ban command. However, you will need to add the new command name and category to the `types.ts` file as well. For example:

```typescript
export enum CommandName {
  // ...
  // Moderation
  Ban = "ban",
}

export enum CommandCategory {
  // ...
  Moderation = "Moderation",
}
```

### Slash commands

You can create slash command options by using `this.data` property. For example, this is how you can add a `String` option:

```typescript
super(client, {
  // ...
});

// Creating slash command options
this.data.addStringOption((option) =>
  option
    .setName("input")
    .setDescription("The input to echo back")
    .setRequired(true)
);
```

To use the options, you need to access them from the `interaction.options` property. For example, this is how you can get the value of the `String` option in your execute method:

```typescript
public async execute(
  interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction
): Promise<void> {
  // The logic of the slash command goes here
  const input = interaction.options.getString("input");
  await interaction.reply({
    content: `You said: ${input}`,
  });
}
```
